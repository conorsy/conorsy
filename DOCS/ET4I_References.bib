	abstract = {Crop evapotranspiration ({ET}) is one of the most important components in many hydrological processes. The crop reference evapotranspiration ({ETo}) represents the atmospheric water demand in each crop type, development stage, and management practices. The Penman-Monteith equation in the version suggested by the Food and Agriculture Organization ({FAO}56-{PM}), is one of the most used methods to estimate {ETo}. In several regions of the world, meteorological observations are not always available. The most recent reanalysis database {ERA}5-Land, released in 2019, can be useful to overcome this limit. The database provides, with a spatial grid of 0.1° latitude and 0.1° longitude, several hourly climate data such as air temperature, dew point temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed components all at 2.0 m above the soil surface, except wind speed components at 10 m, useful to apply the {FAO}56-{PM} equation. The objective of this research is to assess the quality of {ERA}5-Land climate variables data to estimate daily {ETo} in Sicily, Italy. The effect of the weather station’s elevation associated with the statistical indicators was also evaluated to verify how the morphology affects the measurements. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the {FAO}56-{PM} equation was carried out to identify which climate variables have the most influence on the {ETo} estimation. For the period 2006–2015, the comparison between air temperature, global solar radiation, wind speed, and relative air humidity, measured from 39 ground weather stations in Sicily, and {ERA}5-Land was carried out and then, through {FAO}56-{PM} equation daily {ETo} values were estimated using both databases. The statistical indicators Root Mean Square Error ({RMSE}) and Mean Bias Error ({MBE}) confirm the possibility of considering the {ERA}5-Land a suitable solution to estimate {ETo}. The sensitivity analysis showed that good {ETo} estimation depends mainly on the accuracy of the relative air humidity and air temperature data.},

	abstract = {Abstract Evapotranspiration has long been understood to vary with soil moisture in drier regions and to be relatively insensitive to soil moisture in wetter regions. A number of recent studies have quantified this behavior with various model and observational datasets. However, given the disparate approaches and datasets used, uncertainty persists in how the underlying relationships vary in space and time. Here we complement the existing studies by analyzing two datasets as yet untapped for this purpose: a satellite-based evapotranspiration (E) product retrieved using geostationary thermal imagery and a meteorological station-based dataset of daily 2m air temperature (T2M) diurnal amplitudes. Both datasets are analyzed synchronously with soil moisture from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive ({SMAP}) satellite. We thereby derive maps of evaporative regimes that vary in space and time as one might expect, that is, the water-limited regime grows eastward across the conterminous United States ({CONUS}) as spring moves into summer, only to shrink again going into winter. The relationship between the E and soil moisture data appears particularly tight, which is encouraging given that the E data (like the T2M data) were not constructed using any soil moisture information whatsoever. The general agreement between the two independent sets of results gives us confidence that the generated maps correctly represent, to first order, evaporative regime behavior in Nature. The T2M results have the added benefit of highlighting the significant connection between soil moisture and overlying air temperature, a connection relevant to T2M predictability.},

	abstract = {Remotely sensed evapotranspiration ({ET}) data offer strong potential to support data-driven approaches for sustainable water management. However, practitioners require robust and rigorous accuracy assessments of such data. The {OpenET} system, which includes an ensemble of six remote sensing models, was developed to increase access to field-scale (30 m) {ET} data for the contiguous United States. Here we compare {OpenET} outputs against data from 152 in situ stations, primarily eddy covariance flux towers, deployed across the contiguous United States. Mean absolute error at cropland sites for the {OpenET} ensemble value is 15.8 mm per month (17\% of mean observed {ET}), mean bias error is −5.3 mm per month (6\%) and r2 is 0.9. Results for shrublands and forested sites show higher inter-model variability and lower accuracy relative to croplands. High accuracy and multi-model convergence across croplands demonstrate the utility of a model ensemble approach, and enhance confidence among {ET} data practitioners, including the agricultural water resource management community.},

	abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal variability of actual evapotranspiration ({ET}) is a critical issue for better water resources management from plot to basin scale. It is particularly true in the Sahelian region which is very vulnerable in terms of water and agricultural resources, but also very scarcely monitored. This study aims to improve understanding of {ET} in Sahelian agrosystems by comparing twenty {ET} products and collections on two areas in Central Senegal and South-Western Niger: Breathing Earth System Simulation ({BESS}), Derive Optimal Linear Combination Evapotranspiration ({DOLCE}) v2.1 and v3.0, {ERA}5 and {ERA}5-Land, {FLUXCOM}-{RS}, Global Land Data Assimilation System ({GLDAS}) on Noah and Catchment Land Surface Model ({CLSM}), Global Land Evaporation: the Amsterdam Methodology ({GLEAM}) v3.5a, v3.5b, v3.6a and v3.6b, Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications v2 ({MERRA}-2), {MODIS} Global Evapotranspiration products ({MOD}16/{MYD}16), Penman-Monteith Leuning version 2 ({PML}\_V2) v0.1 and v0.1.7, Reliability Ensemble Averaging ({REA}), Simplified Surface Energy Balance for operational applications ({SSEBop}) and Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data ({WaPOR}). In order to assess the abilities and drawbacks of each product, a multi-scale analysis is first performed at local scale with different temporal aggregation levels (daily, decadal, monthly). The best performing products, like {GLEAM}, {MERRA}-2 or {GLDAS}-Noah, have low spatial resolution (≥0.25°), but shows really good agreement with {ET} measurements ({RMSE} ∼ 0.5 mm.d-1, R2 ≥ 0.8). A multi-scale spatial analysis with different spatial aggregation levels (1, 10 and 25 km) is then performed on interannual composite maps of annual and seasonal {ET}. Results highlight the different spatiotemporal behaviour of all the products. Products such as {ERA}5-Land and {PML}\_V2 0.1.7 stand out in this comparison as their higher resolution allows them to describe the spatial patterns of {ET} realistically and more precisely while having relatively good performances at local scale ({RMSE} ∼ 0.6 mm.d-1, R2 ≥ 0.7). Overall, the comparison highlights the need to consider soil moisture to accurately estimate {ET} in the Sahelian region, as the products considering it generally show better performances. It also points out the lack of a high quality and resolution {ET} product over the Sahel. Future satellite missions, as well as data fusion techniques, could help to fill up this gap and propose a reference product on Sahelian ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial evapotranspiration ({ET}) is a key variable in the global water cycle, notably affected by climate change and vegetation greening. However, its intrinsic driving modes and the ways through which driving factors influence it remain largely unexplored. Here, we quantified the internal and external drivers behind the spatiotemporal variability of {ET} across global drylands at seasonal and annual temporal scales and component levels based on pixel-by-pixel partial correlation and ridge regression analyses. The results show that vegetation predominantly drives changes in {ET}, plant canopy transpiration (Ec), evaporation of precipitation intercepted by vegetation (Ei), and soil evaporation (Es) in most regions of the global drylands. This pattern persisted on a seasonal scale. The contribution analysis revealed that vegetation had the strongest influence and the largest contribution to {ET} variation. Temperature was the climatic factor that contributed the most to the driving process of {ET} change and was significantly higher than the other climatic factors. Among the components of {ET}, Es was the predominant constituent part to {ET}, exerting a strong control on its variability. Its absolute contribution (60.3 \%) to this variability was approximately twice that of Ec. Our findings highlight the crucial role of Es and vegetation in driving {ET} across drylands and the potentially important moderating role of Es amid increasing water resource turbulence due to ongoing vegetation greening.},
